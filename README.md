# Bug Tracker Description

This bug tracker application is a full-stack personal project I developed that allows a user to log bugs they encounter while developing their own software, including details such as a description of the bug, the target date to fix the bug, and whether the bug fix has been completed yet. It is built using React and Spring Boot, and provides RESTful API's with full CRUD functionality. Industry standard security protocols are implemented using JWT. ORM concepts are utilized through an h2 in-memory database using JPA and Hibernate.

To run:

Download files to your selected directory. For the server, create a project in Eclipse and import the restful-web-services folder. You may need to download the Maven dependencies to run. Run RestfulWebServicesApplication.java as a Java Application to start the server. 

For the client, navigate to the bugtracker-app folder in the command line and run 'npm install'. After, run 'npm start' to start the client. The client currently runs on port 8080.
