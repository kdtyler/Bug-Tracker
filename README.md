# Bug Tracker Description

This bug tracker application is a full-stack personal project I developed that allows a user to log bugs they encounter while developing their own software, including details such as a description of the bug, the target date to fix the bug, and whether the bug fix has been completed yet. It is built using React and Spring Boot, and provides RESTful API's with full CRUD functionality. Industry standard security protocols are implemented using JWT. ORM concepts are utilized through an h2 in-memory database using JPA and Hibernate.
