# Bug Tracker Description

This bug tracker application is a full-stack personal project I developed that allows a user to log bugs they encounter while developing their own software, including details such as a description of the bug, the target date to fix the bug, and whether the bug fix has been completed yet. It is built using React and Spring Boot, and provides RESTful API's with full CRUD functionality. Currently, basic authentication and security has been implemented using Spring Security. This project is currently in progress, with the following features to be implemented by October 19th, 2021: JWT Spring Security, JPA and Hibernate integration, and deployment to Azure.

Warning:
There is an issue uploading the components file, and as such is in its own directory outside of the client folder at the moment. When running the application, it would be in bugtracker-app/src. A resolution is being worked on.
